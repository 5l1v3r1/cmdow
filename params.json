It does not create any temporary files, nor does it write to the registry. There is no installation procedure, just run it. To completely remove all traces of it from your system, delete it.\r\n\r\nCmdow was written with batch file programmers in mind. Particular attention has been paid to Cmdows output making it easy to process with the 'FOR /F' command found in NT4/2000/XP/2003/2008/7.\r\n\r\nCmdow is simple and intuitive to use. To list all its options, type cmdow /?. For detailed help on any option type cmdow /? <option>. Eg cmdow /? /run. If you want to start using Cmdow right away, skip to examples. \r\n",
